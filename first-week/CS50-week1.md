**Unary:**

Counting on your fingure (highest number 31)

**Base-2:** just need two digits to represent information

computers use 0 & 1

**Binary Digit:** 0 and 1

bit = means single digit 0 or 1

Can use 0 & 1 to represent Instructions

**Bite** is also known as a bit

Think of  turning on a light bulb

Off = 0

On = 1

**How to represent letters:**

Can assign every letter a number

A = 65 | 01000001 (***ascii***)

Uses 8 but to represent the letter

256 total characters to use in ascii

128 **|** 64 **|** 32 **|** 16 **|** 8 **|** 4 **|** 2 **|** 1

We use **Unicode** instead of ascii

unicode is a superset of ascii

unicode can use 16bit, 32bit, or even 64bit

roughly 4 billion characters

*Mission is to present all humans language: past, present, and future*

uses **base-16**

### **Colors:**

**Fitzpatrick scale:** Categorizes skin colors

**RGB: Red + Green + Blue**

is represented with 3 different numbers

each pixel stores 24bits

### **Algorithms:**

step by step instructions to solve some problems

input → **algorithm** → (output = *Return value)*

**PsuedoCode:**

Write your thoughts down precisely

Step by step

**Functions:** Action that tells you what to do

- Parameter or argument customize behavior of a function

**Conditionals:** tells you which way to go

**Boolean:** two possible answers

**Loop:** Cylces

**Abstraction:** to simplify and hide the implementation details

**Return value:** Special argument that takes an input
